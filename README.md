# Climate-Change-Discourse-Project
This repository contains the data, documentation, and code used in the analysis of climate-related discourse in Austrian parliamentary debates, based on the ParlaMint AT corpus.

# Project Description

The project analyzes how climate change was discussed in the Austrian Parliament across two time periods: 1996–1999 and 2019–2022. Using the ParlaMint AT corpus,the project team extracted relevant speeches, identified climate-related terms, and built a relational database to support further linguistic and political analysis.
